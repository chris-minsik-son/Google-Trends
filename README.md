# Andrew Tate VS Donald Trump + Joe Biden

On July 29 2022, Andrew Tate claims to be the most Googled person online: <br />
["I am more Googled than Donald Trump, Joe Biden. Look it up." - Andrew Tate](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/VUYUsj5ZbmQ)
["I'm the most Googled man on the fucking planet" - Andrew Tate](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/VUYUsj5ZbmQ)

Pretty bold statement if you ask me. The first statement above may be believable but to say the most Googled man is an overstatement. We will export the data from Google Trends and use data visualisation tools such as Flourish to verify his claims. Furthermore, we will explore other individuals that are most searched during this timeframe.
