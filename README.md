On July 29 2022, Andrew Tate claims to be the most Googled person online: <br />
["I am more Googled than Donald Trump, Joe Biden. Look it up." - Andrew Tate](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/VUYUsj5ZbmQ) <br />
["I'm the most Googled man on the fucking planet" - Andrew Tate](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/VUYUsj5ZbmQ)

Pretty bold statement if you ask me. We will export the data from Google Trends and use data visualisation tools such as Flourish to verify his claims. Furthermore, we will explore other individuals that are most searched during this timeframe and compare the interest over time.

## Data Exploration
The datasets below were exported from Google Trends and is a comparison of the most searched individuals' interest over time on Google.

#### Dataset 1

| Person       | 1/07/2022 | 2/07/2022 | 3/07/2022 | … | 25/08/2022 | 26/08/2022 | 27/08/2022 |
| ------------ | --------- | --------- | --------- | - | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Andrew Tate  | 12        | 11        | 12        | … | 71         | 58         | 47         |
| Joe Biden    | 11        | 11        | 10        | … | 14         | 13         | 10         |
| Donald Trump | 10        | 9         | 9         | … | 11         | 15         | 14         |

In the dataset above, we will explore the interest over time for Andrew Tate, Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Moreover, we will only be using the data from July and August as the statement was made at the end of July. This is so that we can see the change in pattern before and after the incident.

Using Flourish.Studio, the following viusalisation was created below:

| Person            | 1/07/2022 | 2/07/2022 | 3/07/2022 | … | 27/08/2022 | 28/08/2022 | 29/08/2022 |
| ----------------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | - | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Andrew Tate       | 6         | 5         | 6         | … | 22         | 19         | 16         |
| Elon Musk         | 13        | 17        | 16        | … | 12         | 12         | 13         |
| Kim Kardashian    | 12        | 16        | 15        | … | 12         | 13         | 13         |
| Amber Heard       | 10        | 10        | 10        | … | 4          | 4          | 4          |
| Cristiano Ronaldo | 12        | 16        | 18        | … | 20         | 18         | 16         |

Similarly, we will take the same approach using Dataset 2. However, this time we will explore more individuals that rank at the top for most searched people in 2022. As shown above, we will explore the interest over time for Andrew Tate, Elon Musk, Kim Kardashian, Amber Heard and Cristiano Ronaldo. Same as the previous dataset, we will only be using the data from July and August.
